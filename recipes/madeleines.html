    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        What is a <em>madeleine</em>?
    </p>
    <p>
        Madeleine cookies? Madeleine cake? What the heck are they, right?
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm going to clear it up for you right now
    </p>

    <p>Although many think that madeleines are French shell shaped cookies, they are actually CAKE
    </p>
    <p>The batter is typically baked in a shell-shaped mold and the finished product is often decorated with confectioners' Sugar
    </p>
    <p>These delicate little shell shaped sponge cakes are sweet, buttery, and so DELICIOUS!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter, melted until browned</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons lemon zest, finely grated</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 and 1/4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup confectioners sugar, sifted, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the butter in tablespoons and place them in a heavy saucepan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Once the butter has melted, reduce the heat to low and continue cooking, until the solids sink to the bottom of the pan and turn golden brown, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and pour the browned butter into a small bowl</li>
        <li>Stir the vanilla and lemon zest into the butter, then set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt</li>
        <li>Beat the eggs at medium speed while gradually adding the sugar</li>
        <li>Fold in the flour mixture in three additions, stirring just until combined</li>
        <li>Fold in the butter mixture</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 4 hours</li>
        <li>preheat the oven to 375 degrees (F)</li>
        <li>Brush the molds of your madeleine pan with butter, then lightly dust with flour</li>
        <li>Spoon level scoops of the batter into the center of each mold.</li>
        <li>Bake for 12 minutes, or until the "bellies" have risen and they're golden brown</li>
        <li>Dust with confectioners' sugar and serve warm, with coffee or tea.</li>
    </ol>
